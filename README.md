A simple script to convert a Kinesis Advantage 360 SmartSet layout from Qwerty to Dvorak.
It takes in a layout that works when the OS's layout is QWERTY and creates a layout that works the same when the OS's layout is Dvorak.
This is especially helpful for work laptops where one might like to use the Kinesis Keyboard while occasionally using the laptop's keyboard.

Usage:
```
python layout_translator.py --input-file layout1.txt --output-file layout2.txt
```
